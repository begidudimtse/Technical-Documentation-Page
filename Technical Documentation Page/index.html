       <p>
It’s a New Year, and the chance for a fresh start! I always dream about organizing and planning a whole new year and setting goals for myself to achieve.</p>
       <p>There’s one caveat to planning that I want to get out of the way before we get into the process. You can plan life and set goals, but you can’t control outcomes. In fact, planning has nothing to do with control—it has everything to do with getting started.</P>
       <p> Too many people wander around without a clear purpose. With planning, you can avoid that type of time-wasting and aimlessness. </p>

        <p>Maybe you had a bad experience - you planned and you planned and then absolutely nothing went according to plan and you thought, why bother? </p>
      <ol>
          <li>Focusing on the Tactics Without Getting Clear on the Strategy</li>
           <li>Preplanning Too Much Detail Too Far in Advance</li>
           <li>Focusing Too Much on the 'How' Instead of the 'What' & 'Why'</li>
           <li>Being Stubbornly Tied to the Plan</li>
           <li>Spending All of Your Time Planning Instead of Implementing</li>

         <p>Write down all the projects and events that you already know about: for example upcoming retreats, workshops, holidays, and maybe even some online course launches.</p>
         <p>If you’re thinking “I have no idea what I’ll be doing in 10 months’ time!”, that’s totally normal – you only really need to be specific over the upcoming quarter or so, so just fill in what you know now. Remember, at this stage, it’s only acting as a general overview.</p>
        <p>he biggest mistake I see with ambitious people is that they overestimate what they can achieve within a year. Remember that the key to continuous progress is making consistent steps forward. You’ll be surprised what you can achieve over five years.</p>

       <p>At the end of every month have a look at the month ahead and plan it out in more detail.</p>
        
       
       <code>
           What’s happening?
What deadlines do you need to put on your calendar?
What are you planning to create?</code>
      <code>
What newsletters do you want to send out?</code>
       <code>
If you have a blog or podcast or youtube channel, plan the content for the month ahead as well.

       <header>plan the week</header>
       <p>Instead of just working on my to-do list and getting lost in the nitty-gritty jobs, what I like to do is to reserve time each day of the week for certain tasks to work on.</p>
       <code>“What do I need to achieve this week to move a little bit closer to my 1-year plan?”</code>

       <header>plan the day</header>
       <p>Of course, other things may have cropped up like a doctor’s appointment or a new call, so make sure to add these in and then reevaluate your list. Is everything that is scheduled for today still realistic? If not, reschedule some tasks now instead of at the end of the day.</p>
